<p>My next task using JavaScript involved doing practicals on functions and advanced control flow. The instructions were to: Create a function that is able to return a specific percentage of any number. For example you want to know what 30% of 135 is.</p>
<p>The next part of the task involved using a switch statement, where the user would be able to order 3 different types of drinks and also be able to select 3 different sizes. Cola, Lemonade and Orangeade and Small, Medium and Large. Create a function that will output the message “You have ordered a {size} of {softDrinkLabel}”</p>
<p>The final part of the task was to create a calculator using a function. This function would be capable of using the addition, subtraction, multiply, divider or modulus operator on 2 numbers provided.</p>
<p>The practicals were probably the most diffcult I have done so far involving JavaScript, but in particular, I had the most trouble getting my head around switch statements. At first, I did not understand how to use them and why I would use them instead of using 'else if' statements, which can give you the same result. However, after looking back on the session recording and attempting the switch statement practical again, I had a better understanding of how and why they are used, as they can also save time and require fewer lines of code compared to 'else if' statements.</p>

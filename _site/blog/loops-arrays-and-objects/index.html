<p>This week was focused on Loops, Arrays and Objects. Going into this, I had little knowledge of the subject, so it was a new experience learning about how they are used. The instructions for the tasks were to: Write a loop that outputs the 7 times table, from 7 x 1 = 7 to 7 x 12 = 84.</p>
<p>Create an array of your favourite foods. Print some of them to the screen. Use a for loop to print a list of all your favourite foods.</p>
<p>Create an object to hold information on your favourite recipe. Then display the properties on screen. Add a function called letsCook. Have it say: "I'm hungry! Let's cook..." with the name of your recipe title. Call your new method.</p>
<p>I found that after learning how loops, arrays and objects are used, and how they are written, coming up with my own wasn't too difficult, as I found them quite easy to understand, compared to tasks from previous weeks.</p>

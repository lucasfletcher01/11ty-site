<p>This week I began to learn about the DOM, or the Document Object Model. Before this, I had no knowlege of the DOM, so I had a new subject to try and understand how it all worked. The instructions for the tasks were a little different for this week, as there were 6 seperate tasks, with the final one putting the previous 5 all together. There was also a lot of code involved, more than any previous week, so I will just cover the final task for this week. The instructions were as follows:</p>
<p>Get the form by ID from the forms collection. Get the todo pane (the 'ul' element) to insert todos into. Get the text input for the title. Get the priority select element. Get a *live* list of all elements with the 'todo' class.</p>
<p>Add an event listener that will: Create a new todo. The details should come from the form. Insert it into the DOM. Clear the title input ready to create a new todo note. Prevent the default behaviour (ie don't submit to a server).</p>
<p>Create the text node with the variable 'title'. Create a new list item element to contain the text node. Add the text node to the list item element. Return the new element.</p>
<p>Learning about the DOM was quite confusing for me and it was definiteley a challenge. Certain tasks like 'Get the form by ID' are very simple looking back on it, but most of the other tasks I feel weren't as straightforward, so I will need to go back over it to familiarise myself more with the DOM so I can come to more of an understanding of the subject.</p>

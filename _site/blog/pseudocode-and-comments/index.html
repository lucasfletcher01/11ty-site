<p>This week, I was learning about Pseudocode & Comments. I already had some knowledge of comments, as I would sometimes use them to break my code down into sections, if there were a lot of lines and it was hard to follow. Pseudocode was new to me though and it was interesting learning about how it is structured and what kind of terms you would use to write a description. The instructions for the tasks were to: Add comments to one of your past JS tasks from a previous lesson. Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read by creating an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and already read (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).</p>
<p>Create an object to hold information on your favourite recipes. It should have properties for: recipeTitle (a string), servings (a number), ingredients (an array of strings), directions (a string). List all recipes and create a loop to list all the ingredients.</p>
<p>Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurrences of its first character have been replaced with ‘*****’, except for the first character itself. You can assume that the string is at least one character long.</p>
<p>I found the tasks to be easier to understand compared to last weeks tasks, as it was mostly just writing instructions on what to do. I did attempt to do each task in my own way, and after, I watched back the recording of the session to refine my answers and make sure that they're written in the right way and using the correct terminology.</p>

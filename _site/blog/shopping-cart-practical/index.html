<p>Following on from learning about Loops, Arrays and Objects, now it was time for a practical. I would be using an array of objects provided as a simple shopping cart example.
I would then need to work out the total cost of the items in the shopping cart. The instructions for the tasks were to: Create a function that takes 1 argument (the array). Create a variable inside the function called “totalPrice”. Loop through each item in the array and add the value of the item to the total price, remember to account for the quantity. Return the totalPrice Variable. Console.log the returned value.</p>
<p>Create a function that takes 1 argument (the array). Create a variable inside the function called “totalPrice”. Loop through each item in the array and add the value of the item to the total price, remember to account for the quantity. If the item has a type of “food” the total price is 20% less, return the totalPrice Variable.</p>
<p>Add 2 extra arguments to the function for “discountAmount” and “type”. Replace the logic that takes off 20% for object.type == “food” for object.type == type and allow the 20% to be the {discountAmount}%. Create logic so that if type == “any” all products have a discount applied.</p>
<p>The next part was to work out which items cost between 2 price points. So for example, we need the cart to be returned by which products cost more than £2 but less than £5: Create a function that has 3 arguments “cart”, “lowPrice” and “highPrice”. Create an empty array called arrItems at the start of the function. Loop through each item of the array. If the price value is higher than or equal to the lowPrice and lower than or equal to the highPrice push to arrItems. Add an additional argument to the function “quantity” this is going to be a boolean. If quantity == true then account for the total price with the quantity included as being between lowPrice and highPrice.</p>
<p>The final part of the practical was to define an array of random numbers, then create functions that are be able to return the mean, median and mode of the numbers.</p>

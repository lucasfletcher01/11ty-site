<h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>After hearing about coding bootcamps, I decided that it would be a great opportunity to refresh and refine my skills in Web Design & Development, as well as improve my knowledge in weaker areas that I had difficulty with previously in university.</p>

  <p>Out of the different courses that I researched online, I found a Web Design & Development course run by <a href="https://thecodersguild.org.uk/course-directory/get-hired-as-a-software-developer/">The Coders Guild</a>. After looking at the schedule for the course, I decided that this would be the best fit for me, as I could refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS and improve my skills with JavaScript.</p>

  <p>The course ran for 12 weeks, with each week having 1 or 2 sessions. After each session, tasks would be set for each person attending the course, so that we could show what we learned.</p>

  <p>The first half of the course covered HTML and CSS, semantic HTML & accessibility, frameworks, source control, static site builders, git workflows and form processing. I already had good experience with HTML and CSS, as well as frameworks such as Bootstrap going into the course, but refreshing my knowledge was helpful. Source control, static site builders and git workflows were new subjects to me, and I had no previous experience working with these, so it was interesting to learn about each, and further improve my web development knowledge.</p>

  <p>The second half of the course focused on JavaScript. This was one of my weaker areas from studying Web Design/Development in university, so I was looking forward to revisiting the language and improve my knowledge and skills. The subjects covered were programming concepts, functions & control flow, pseudocode & comments, loops, arrays & objects, and the DOM. Each of the subjects other than programming concepts and pseudocode & comments also had a practical session, where instead of going away and doing the tasks in our own time, we did them during the session and gained feedback. I enjoyed re-learning JavaScript and I feel that I did benefit from the sessions, although I would have to go and look back on my work for some aspects to make sure I fully understand everything.</p>

  <p>Overall, after completing the course, I would say that I achieved the outcome I was hoping for, which was to refresh myself on HTML and CSS and improve my knowledge of JavaScript.</p>

<p>My first task using JavaScript was to create a program to calcaulate a tip. The instructions were to: create variables for the pre-tip total and the tip percentage, calculate a new total and output a sentence to the page showing what the total bill is with the tip. I also managed to use the toFixed() method to round the total to 2 decimal places, and displayed the tip amount, in addition to the total bill.</p>
<p>Although this was a simple task to do, I was slightly confused at the beginning, as I did not have much experience with JavaScript and I was just learning about variables. However, after looking back at what I learned during the session, and doing some research online, I quickly figured out how to carry out the task and I understood how it all worked.</p>
